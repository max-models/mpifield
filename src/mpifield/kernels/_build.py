"""The options every kernel folder passes to :meth:`cunumpy.kernels.Kernel.from_folder`.

The ``__init__.py`` of a kernel folder ``mpifield/kernels/<name>/`` declares its
kernel with these::

    kernel = xp.kernels.Kernel.from_folder(__name__, **KERNEL_OPTIONS)

which finds ``<name>_pyccel.py``, ``<name>_numpy.py`` and ``<name>_cuda.cu`` in
the folder.
Nothing is compiled here: the Pyccel version is compiled on its first host call
(cached on disk by :func:`~mpifield.kernels.compile.compile_cached`), the CUDA
version on its first launch. Importing this module needs neither Pyccel nor CuPy.
